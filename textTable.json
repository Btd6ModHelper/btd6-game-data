  "DialogueMermonkeyQuest1InGameOnRound2_2": "I can feel the chill in the air! Their tridents now have an icey, magical aura. The tridents will freeze Bloons and a magical wave grows as the projectile travels.",
  "DialogueMermonkeyQuest1InGameOnRound2_3": "This is quite exciting! I want to see if the wave breaks when it gets too big or hits something.",
  "DialogueMermonkeyQuest1InGameOnRound2WaveBreak_1": "You could surf on those waves! Amazing!",
  "DialogueMermonkeyQuest1InGameOnRound3_1": "Woah! That Mermonkey just called a monster up from the depths! Those are some slimy looking tentacles. My PhD in Abyssal Creature Biology is being put to good use!",
  "DialogueMermonkeyQuest1InGameOnRound3_2": "From the 8 tentacles I can tell each one independently targets Bloons in front of them. They'll slam down in a 360 degree ring dealing massive damage. This means the creature's power can be maximized when surrounded by Bloons.",
  "DialogueMermonkeyQuest1InGameOnRound3_3": "That Mermonkey has upgrades from the bottom path too, so it can see Camo Bloons. That's lucky, as a Camo rush is about to come out.",
  "DialogueMermonkeyQuest1InGameOnRound4_1": "Another Tier 3! This time on the bottom path. That Mermonkey will produce a melody when Bloons are nearby, entrancing them into a spiral so other Monkeys can target them.",
  "DialogueMermonkeyQuest1InGameOnRound4_2": "At higher levels the Mermonkey will be able to project the sound through a magic conch, moving the center of the trance if they wish.",
  "DialogueMermonkeyQuest1InGameOnRound4_3": "Sounds great huh? Let's see it in action!",
  "DialogueMermonkeyQuest1InGameOnRound4Melody_1": "That music... it's, so... calming...",
  "DialogueMermonkeyQuest1Victory_1": "Oh I dozed off. I hope I didn't miss anything!\nHey Scoop, can you do some field research for me? Some Mermonkeys were spotted along the coast near their only known home.",
  "DialogueMermonkeyQuest1Victory_2": "Sure thing Patch, I'll get the scoop!",
  "DialogueMermonkeyQuest2InGameOnRoundIntro_1": "You made it! These Mermonkeys have emerged from their magical cave to help stop the Bloons. We can't let the Bloons discover the entrance so let's stop them here!",
  "DialogueMermonkeyQuest2InGameOnRoundIntro_2": "The Battle is well underway, but the Monkeys need your strategic help to guarantee victory.",
  "DialogueMermonkeyQuest2InGameOnRound63_1": "These photographs I'm getting of these incredibly rare Monkeys will win me National Monkeygraphic Photographer of the Year!",
  "DialogueMermonkeyQuest2InGameOnZOMGPopped_1": "Yehaa! Take that ZOMG!",
  "DialogueMermonkeyQuest2InGameOnBADSpawned_1": "B for Bloons. A for Are. D for Dinguses!",
  "DialogueMermonkeyQuest2Victory_1": "The Mermonkeys are concerned that the Bloons were able to get so close. I think they're going to return to join the fight!",
  "DartlingGunnerQuest0Description": "Try out the Dartling Gunner!",
  "DartlingGunnerQuest0DescriptionLong": "Beat Park Path with Dartling Gunners!",
  "DartlingGunnerQuest1VictoryScreen": "Well done! You and the Dartling Gunners defeated the Bloons on Park Path!",
  "DialogueDartlingGunnerQuest1InGameOnRound1_1": "Lock and load! I've done my research and Dartling Gunners are widely regarded as the best Monkey.",
  "DialogueDartlingGunnerQuest1InGameOnRound1_2": "Three super powerful upgrade paths and a high rate of fire. With a little bit of aiming, the possibilities are practically endless!",
  "DialogueDartlingGunnerQuest1InGameOnRound1_3": "Park Path has been set up for you to try the Dartling Gunner and have some fun. It's gonna get a bit tricky near the end but don't fear, you can always rely on Dartling Gunners.",
