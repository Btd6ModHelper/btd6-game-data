Team tickets do not contribute to personal leaderboard placing.\n• Once captured, Tile scores will slowly degrade over time, until the Tile eventually becomes neutral.\n• CT Points are earned when capturing a Tile and every hour that you continue to hold a Tile. CT Points decide your personal and Team placing on the leaderboard, so grab Tiles as often as you can!\n• Banner Tiles are harder Tiles that give lots more CT Points.\n• Relic Tiles give your team access to powerful Relic Knowledges that will in turn help you when capturing Tiles.\n• Tile progress is saved every 20 rounds and you can only have one in-progress save at a time.\n• Sign up to compete against the best in Competitive Mode, or take it easy in Casual play. Whatever your skill level, find the one that works best for your team.",

  "DialogueScoopsTaleIQuest1UI1": "Once upon a time three monkeys from a small unnamed town were called upon by a Super Monkey.",
  "DialogueScoopsTaleIQuest1UI2": "The Super Monkey knew that the Bloons were preparing to attack, and, despite his impressive speed, he would not be able to get there in time.",
  "DialogueScoopsTaleIQuest1UI3": "The three brave monkeys would need to take the Chinooks and mount a defense at Monkey Meadow. It was their duty.",
  "DialogueScoopsTaleIQuest1InGame1": "The Chinooks dropped them off just before the Bloons arrived. They had limited resources but were expecting cash to arrive every few rounds.",

  "DialogueScoopsTaleIQuest1InGameOnRound10_1": "Soon it became apparent that this wouldn't be a walk in the park. There were still Bloons incoming. With MOABs on the way!",
  "DialogueScoopsTaleIQuest1InGameOnRound10_2": "The Engineer checked her nail-gun. \"Perhaps two will work,\" she muttered to herself.",
  "DialogueScoopsTaleIQuest1DefeatInGame1": "And then the Bloons... wait, that's not what happened.",
  "DialogueScoopsTaleIQuest2UI1": "The first Bloon attack had been thwarted, but the Super Monkey was still racing across the skies. More Bloons were on their way and the three brave monkeys knew their job wasn't finished.",
  "DialogueScoopsTaleIQuest2UI2": "An ancient, culturally important spring was in danger and they didn't have much time. They would make their stand at the fallen tree and once again called upon the Chinooks.",

  "DialogueScoopsTaleIQuest3UI1": "They had done it! Or so they thought...",

  "DialogueScoopsTaleIQuest3InGame1": "They managed to find a way below ground, and the flying skills of the Chinooks got them to the chutes where they would make their stand.",
  "DialogueScoopsTaleIQuest3InGame2": "But just as they got there, the Chinooks' flying skills ran out and two were caught in some vines, crash landing and removing themselves from the fight.",
  "DialogueScoopsTaleIQuest3InGame3": "The Engineer would have to hold off the first waves of the attack while the one remaining Chinook helped her friends.",
  "DialogueScoopsTaleIQuest3InGameOnRound16_1": "The Bloons kept coming, and each wave was stronger than the last. Over the hubbub of battle, the three monkeys heard the Chinook's radio crackle.",
  "DialogueScoopsTaleIQuest3InGameOnRound16_2": "\"I'm nearly there.\" It was the Super Monkey! \"Hold on a little longer!\"",
  "DialogueScoopsTaleIQuest3InGameOnRound23_1": "\"What did I miss?\" said the Super Monkey heroically. He was in Tech Terror form!",
  "DialogueScoopsTaleIQuest3InGameOnRound23_2": "\"Maybe you didn't need me after all.\"",
  "DialogueScoopsTaleIQuest3DefeatInGame1": "And Monkey Civilization was razed to the ground. Hold on, something's gone wrong.",
