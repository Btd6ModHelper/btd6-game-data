  "1stTutorial2QuincyPlaced_2": "Yes, Patch, I've boosted Quincy here, and temporarily unlocked all upgrades for Dart Monkeys and Bomb Shooters, just for now.",
  "1stTutorial2QuincyPlaced_3": "They will still need to be unlocked normally for any other games.",
  "1stTutorial2QuincyPlaced_4": "Thanks, Dr. Monkey - that's so helpful!",
  "1stTutorial2DartMonkeyUpgraded_1": "You've got it! That upgrade will let this Dart Monkey see Camo Bloons.",
  "1stTutorial2CamoWarning_1": "Eyes wide open - a Camo Bloon is on its way. These sneaky Bloons are invisible to most Monkeys.",
  "1stTutorial2CamoWarning_2": "Some Heroes can see Camo, and many Monkeys have upgrades that give them Camo detection.",
  "1stTutorial2CamoWarning_3": "Dart Monkeys can see Camo Bloons with the second upgrade on the bottom path.",
  "1stTutorial2CamoWarning_4": "Place a Dart Monkey near the track and upgrade it to Enhanced Eyesight. In Monkey speak, we call this the x-x-2 upgrade position. You'll figure it out.",
  "1stTutorial2CamoPopped_1": "You're getting it! That was just one Camo Bloon, but there are lots more on Round 33.",
  "1stTutorial2CamoPopped_2": "Bloons love to repeat their patterns, which we call rounds. You'll start to learn which rounds have which Bloons so you can prepare your defenses.",
  "1stTutorial2CamoPopped_3": "We started halfway into this round set, so make sure to place enough Monkeys to defend us!",
  "1stTutorial2Round28_1": "Hold on! I spotted six Lead Bloons nearby. Let's make a note of that - round 28, Lead Bloons.",
  "1stTutorial2Round28_2": "These Bloons are tough! Sharp projectiles like darts bounce right off them!",
  "1stTutorial2Round28_3": "Plenty of Monkeys can pop Leads, but many need upgrades. Bomb Shooters can do it from the get-go!",
  "1stTutorial2Round28_4": "Place a Bomb Shooter, or another Lead popping Monkey if you have one.",
  "1stTutorial2Round30_1": "More Lead Bloons are coming on round 30.",
  "1stTutorial2Round30_2": "You know the drill! Bomb Shooters or another Monkey with an upgrade that lets them pop Lead Bloons.",
  "1stTutorial2Round33_1": "On round 33 there's a whole lot of Camo Bloons.",
  "1stTutorial2Round33_2": "If Quincy is level 5, he can detect Camo. Otherwise make sure you have some Dart Monkeys with x-x-2 upgrade.",
  "1stTutorial2Complete_1": "That's some of the trickier Bloons covered. It looks like you're getting the hang of things, but the Bloons don't stop!",
  "1stTutorial2Complete_2": "Check out stage 3 to learn how to destroy MOABs!",
  "1stTutorial3Introduction_1": "Welcome back, I knew you were curious to find out more.",
  "1stTutorial3Introduction_2": "But the Bloons don't make it easy.",
  "1stTutorial3Introduction_3": "On the next round you'll encounter a Rainbow Bloon.",
  "1stTutorial3Introduction_4": "Rainbow Bloons contain two Zebras. But those stripes aren't for camouflage. It's a reminder they are immune to Ice attacks, and Explosive attacks, like Bomb Shooters.",
  "1stTutorial3Introduction_5": "Once the Bloons get warmed up in these later rounds, lots of Bloons appear to try to push past your defenses.",
  "1stTutorial3Introduction_6": "Place some Monkeys around the track. Don't forget Quincy! And don't worry if you need to Restart - that's what learning is for!",
  "1stTutorial3QuincyPlaced_1": "Level 10 already! And a sweet new ability! This is awesome.",
  "1stTutorial3QuincyPlaced_2": "Yes, Patch, I've boosted Quincy here, and temporarily unlocked all upgrades for the Primary Monkey Towers, just for now.",
  "1stTutorial3CeramicWarning_1": "Great work, especially with those rounds ramping up!",
  "1stTutorial3CeramicWarning_2": "Round 38 coming up has another big Bloon rush followed by one of the toughest normal Bloons - the Ceramic Bloon.",
  "1stTutorial3CeramicWarning_3": "Ceramic Bloons have a strong outer shell that has 10 health. That means you need to do 10 damage to pop the outer ceramic layer.",
  "1stTutorial3CeramicWarning_4": "And then they contain 2 Rainbow Bloons. That's a lot of popping!",
  "1stTutorial3CeramicWarning_5": "Any Monkey can damage Ceramics, but sometimes you just need a lot of Monkeys!",
  "1stTutorial3MOAB_1": "So here we go, one last particularly mean round featuring one MOAB that you need to take down.",
  "1stTutorial3MOAB_2": "A MOAB moves slowly but has 200 health on its outer layer. You need to do a lot of damage, and then deal with the four Ceramic Bloons that will come out.",
  "1stTutorial3MOAB_3": "Let's get our defenses set! A Bomb Shooter at x-3-x does extra damage to MOABs. Place and upgrade one of those, and then enough upgraded Monkeys to clean up the Ceramics.",
  "1stTutorial3MOABLeaked_1": "Oh no the MOAB got through! Retry the last round to try again.",
  "1stTutorial3Complete_1": "Congratulations - you did it! Winning round 40 will earn the victory rewards for an Easy game. The learning you take from this should help you reach round 60, 80, 100 or even higher!",
  "1stTutorialLostGame": "Oops! Looks like you didn't have enough Monkeys! You can retry though, that's what learning is for!",

  "DialogueChurchillTestQuest1InGameOnRound3_2": "At level 6, Churchill gets issued some binoculars that allow him to see Camo Bloons. Let's clear a round of Camo Bloons and get to the big guns.",

  "DialogueChurchillTestQuest1InGameOnRound6_2": "You might want to place some other towers to beat the rest of the rounds, but Churchill told me that he can do it all himself if you just buff him. If you want to prove to the True Sun God you have what it takes you could try that.",

  "DesperadoQuest1IntroDialogue_1": "Well howdy there friend! Come on, gather round. There's a Desperado in town!",
  "DesperadoQuest1IntroDialogue_2": "Desperado starts with a pistol, and each path improves Desperado's weaponry. Dual six shot revolvers on the top path, a long range rifle on mid, or powerful shotgun on bottom path.",
  "DesperadoQuest1IntroDialogue_3": "Watch that Desperado clean up round one and then let me tell you a little about this rootin' tootin' Monkey!",
  "DesperadoQuest1Round2Dialogue_1": "At lower levels Desperado can only shoot one Bloon at a time, so it's important to maximize the conditional speed buffs at low tier upgrades. Placing Desperado far away from Bloons, without other Monkeys in range, or where there will be a lot of Bloons in range depending on the upgrades of each Desperado.",
  "DesperadoQuest1Round2Dialogue_2": "Desperado gains camo detection with the first middle path upgrade but needs tier 3 on the middle path to deal with Lead Bloons. Bottom path Desperado might not like being around other Monkeys, but still needs their support.",
  "DesperadoQuest1EndDialogue_1": "That's enough target practice. Word is a posse of Bloons are approaching Sunset Gulch to destroy the bridge!",
  "DesperadoQuest1EndDialogue_2": "Go and meet the Desperados to help clean up the riff raff!",
  "DesperadoQuest2IntroDialogue_1": "The Bloons are fast approaching, you got here just in time! Upgrade the Desperado close to the track to 0-0-3 in order to take down the Bloons.",
  "DesperadoQuest2IntroUpgrade_1": "When Desperado has a second weapon they get two ranges. One for the pistol and another for the second weapon. That Desperado will pull out a powerful shotgun when Bloons are close.",
  "DesperadoQuest2Round2Dialogue_1": "Lead Bloons are about to come out but that middle path Desperado can't see the track! Upgrade it to 0-3-0 and watch as the powerful long range rifle blasts the Lead Bloons!",
  "DesperadoQuest2Round3Dialogue_1": "Nicely done! There's still a lot of Bloons on the way to destroy the bridge. Don't let them get too far or all of this will be for nothing.",
  "SpikeFactory Paragon": "Mega Massive Munitions Factory",
  "BombShooter Paragon": "Ballistic Obliteration Missile Bunker",

  "EziliTestQuestDialogue1_1": "Ooh this place is scary. I'm glad we're here with Ezili. She's so powerful and little! How could you not feel safe with Ezili around?",
  "EziliTestQuestDialogue1_2": "Ezili wields dark magic to curse Bloons. Cursed Bloons are damaged over time and nearby Bloons are damaged when the curse is applied.",
  "EziliTestQuestDialogue1_3": "If there are lots of spaced Bloons, especially fast ones, Ezili can have trouble. But her powerful curse is still awesome!",
  "EziliTestQuestDialogue2_1": "Ezili can Curse Bloons through walls, and as she levels up she gets more range, attack speed, and begins cursing multiple Bloons at once.",
  "EziliTestQuestDialogue2_2": "Ezili can pop Camo and Lead Bloons, making her a very useful Hero as long as you have other Monkeys to make up for her slower attack speed.",
  "EziliTestQuestDialogue3_1": "At level 3 Ezili gets the Heartstopper ability. When activated, Bloons can't regrow and Purple Bloons are vulnerable to all attacks.",
  "EziliTestQuestDialogue3_2": "Activate Heartstopper on this round when the Purples come out.",
  "EziliTestQuestDialogue4_1": "Ezili's level 7 ability is Sacrificial Totem. This places a totem on the map that gives nearby monkeys Camo detection, extra pierce, range, attack speed, and projectile speed (especially to Wizards).",
  "EziliTestQuestDialogue4_2": "Using the totem drains lives. 10 at first, but only 1 at level 16.",
  "EziliTestQuestDialogue4_3": "Activate Sacrificial Totem on this round to destroy the Bloon wave.",
  "EziliTestQuestDialogue5_1": "At level 10 Ezili gets the MOAB Hex ability. This places a powerful Curse on a MOAB-class Bloon and uses Ezili's target priority to pick the target. Hexed MOABs take damage every second until annihilated and release no children when destroyed.",
  "EziliTestQuestDialogue5_2": "If there is another MOAB-class Bloon around when the Hexed MOAB is destroyed, the Hex will transfer to the next MOAB.",
  "EziliTestQuestDialogue5_3": "Activate MOAB Hex on this round once the BFBs are in range of the Wizard Monkey and watch them all go up in magical smoke!",
  "EziliTestQuestDialogue6_1": "Now place some more Monkeys and finish off the rest of the rounds!",
  "SilasTestQuestDialogue1_1": "Let me introduce Silas. He's one cool cat! Or should I say Monkey?",
  "SilasTestQuestDialogue1_2": "Silas uses a special form of magical ice to attack the Bloons. He can be placed on land or water, see Camo Bloons from level 1, and boosts ice attacks of other Monkeys.",
  "SilasTestQuestDialogue1_3": "The first hit won't damage a Bloon, but apply what's called a Rime debuff. This slows them down and will make them take more damage from ice attacks.",
  "SilasTestQuestDialogue1_4": "That means when Silas hits a Rimed Bloon, the Bloon will take damage and be frozen!",
  "SilasTestQuestDialogue1_5": "Then when that Bloon is hit again, it will release a burst of icy iceness, doing even more damage!",
  "SilasTestQuestDialogue2_1": "At level 2, Ice Monkeys in Silas' range create orbiting Ice Projectiles when they attack. Just a few at first, but more as Silas Levels up.",
  "SilasTestQuestDialogue2_2": "Silas' level 3 ability Frostbite allows Silas to hit white Bloons and detonates frozen Bloons when hit.",
  "SilasTestQuestDialogue2_3": "See this in action on this round, and use the ability to destroy all the White Bloons!",
  "SilasTestQuestDialogue3_1": "Silas gets abilities at almost every level. You can learn about all the little extras by reading the upgrades screen for Silas. But here I'll take you over some of the bigger powers.",
  "SilasTestQuestDialogue3_2": "At level 4 Silas creates Ice Walls on the track nearby. These push back and freeze Bloons that can be frozen.",
  "SilasTestQuestDialogue3_3": "And at level 6 Silas can use the range of Ice Monkeys to attack.",
  "SilasTestQuestDialogue3_4": "Watch that in action on the next round!",
  "SilasTestQuestDialogue4_1": "Level 7 ability, Frozen Cascade. When activated, Silas releases an icy explosion around himself, then Ice Monkeys release an icy explosion spreading out from Silas.",
  "SilasTestQuestDialogue4_2": "On the next round, wait till the Bloons are in range of the last Ice Monkey and then use Silas' level 7 ability.",
  "SilasTestQuestDialogue5_1": "Level 10 ability, Frozen Burial, freezes and damages all Bloons, with extra damage to already frozen Bloons. Then Ice Walls are created along the path.",
  "SilasTestQuestDialogue5_2": "Use this ability on the next round to clear the bloons!",
  "SilasTestQuestDialogue6_1": "There's a lot of depth to Silas! And remember, some Mermonkey and Druid upgrades also have ice attacks!",
  "SilasTestQuestDialogue6_2": "Place some more Monkeys and finish the rest of the rounds!",

  "BlockedPath2_2": "Dynamite Bloons?",
  "BlockedPath2_4": "Hold your horses, you said they explode?",

  "AmbushInSandyTown_4": "That’s your key takeaway?",
  "AmbushInSandyTown_6": "Wait, what about those banana cookies?",
  "AmbushInSandyTown3_1": "Do you need some help back there?",
  "AmbushInSandyTown3_5": "Then shouldn’t we all go help?",

  "TownIsSaved3_2": "Hey! Wait! What are you talking about?  Ah, he’s gone. Scout, what just happened?",
  "TownIsSaved3_4": "Well, sure. And a little something to wash it down. That Monkey mentioned something about a Saloon. I’m gonna get a cactus juice.",

  "LeftBehind_12": "That’s very nice an’ all, Mr Mayor, but I never agreed to-",

  "TheSaloon_3": "Sounds worth a look, but I'm not planning any adventures.",
  "TheSaloon_5": "You aren't the best listener are you?",
  "TheGeneralStore_2": "So I can spend Bananite here, too?",
  "TheGeneralStore_4": "And will I be receivin’ much of it as the new Sheriff?",
  "TheGeneralStore2_1": "I could hightail it outta here. But these folks do need the help, that's sure as shootin’.",
  "WatersOfSandytown_2": "Well, fine, considerin' I've been appointed Sheriff of a town I just stumbled into.",
  "WatersOfSandytown_4": "Right, so any second now I'm gonna feel inspired to catch a fish I take it?",

  "WatersOfSandytown_9": "I lived in the Frontier up until this mornin'…",
  "FishingHole_1": "Well, here's the fishin' hole. I might as well catch a few. The Bananite’ll come in handy, and it is mighty relaxin’.",
  "FishingDone_2": "You sounded more interested in the Bananite to me.",
  "FishingDone3_2": "Mr Mayor sure is an interesting character.",
  "FishingDone3_6": "Sure can. I mean, apparently it's my job now.",
  "FirstAssignment_2": "You said something ‘bout Bloons nearby?",
  "DirkQuickshot2_2": "It would seem so.",

  "FurtherOutbreaks_2": "You're not so bad yourself.",
  "Campfire_2": "Lucky me.",
  "Campfire_4": "More like far and fetched.",
  "Campfire_5": "Say, I could use a sit down. We've been on our feet for a while.",
  "Campfire2_2": "Uh, I’ll pretend I understood all that. Is fast travel like being on a stagecoach?",
  "CampfireAmbush_1": "So, you don't live in Sandytown?",
  "CampfireAmbush_3": "So you work more like a mercenary for hire?",
  "CampfireAmbush_6": "More of them!?",

  "ClearedTheRidge2_5": "Sure, when I’m ready I'll head up and meet you and Dirk at Sunset Gulch. Hopefully he doesn't quickshot me by accident!",

  "FindAnything2_1": "Any luck Scout?",
  "FindAnything2_5": "Who's Hazel?",
  "FindAnything3_2": "I’m not one to comment on names.",

  "BloonTracking_2": "Wouldn’t that just make it a weed?",
  "BloonTracking6_1": "She figured that out just by smelling the air?",
  "Streambed_4": "Tiptoein’ around leaves ain’t for me. Bloons I can handle.",
  "HazelTracking2_1": "Did she just?",
  "HazelTracking3_2": "You can figure that out by eating dirt!?",
  "HazelTracking3_5": "I ate mudpies as an infant, does that count?",
  "APattern_1": "Where to next?",
  "APattern_3": "Well I’ll be. Eating rocks now?",

  "FinalPush_4": "*munch munch* This dirt is taking me north of here.",
  "FinalPush_5": "*munch* And maybe a little east?",
  "FinalPush_8": "Like burnt dirt, with a tinge of north-east, which weirdly tastes like banana cookies. I actually just might be hungry.",
  "CaveFound_2": "I still have a bad taste in my mouth.",
  "CaveFound_4": "We can’t turn back now.",
  "CaveFound_6": "Quit your worryin’, I’ve got a lantern with me and my pistol.",
  "TheCave_3": "Don't turn tail now. Pretend you're out in the Frontier hiding snacks from a certain someone.",
  "CaveExplore_1": "Hmm… Hazel, which way do you think?",
  "CaveExplore_3": "I guess I'll flip a coin.",
  "CaveExplore2_1": "Left it is!",
  "UndergroundChaos2_5": "Shhh. Everybody quiet.",
  "UndergroundChaos3_1": "More Bloons to the right.",
  "UndergroundChaos3_3": "We’re trying to find the source of the Bloons, Scout, not run away from them! Come on.",
  "Underground_1": "Found it! Bring it on, Bloons!",
  "AClueFromThePast_1": "That was a close one. Everyone alright?",
  "AClueFromThePast3_4": "Oh no...",
  "AClueFromThePast3_6": "We should head straight back to Sandytown and report this to Mr Mayor. I'll fill you in then, too.",
  "AClueFromThePast6_1": "There's some light coming from that direction. Maybe there's a quicker way out?",
  "Shortcut_1": "Hey, there's a ladder here? That seems useful!",
  "TownSinkhole_2": "This isn’t good. Let’s find Mr Mayor.",
  "ThreatReveal_1": "Mr Mayor!",
  "ThreatReveal_3": "I am now. We need to talk.",
  "ThreatReveal2_1": "This is a more serious place?",
  "ThreatReveal2_3": "Well, to put it simply, as I was helpin’ others out, it led us to this cave.",
  "ThreatReveal2_4": "While we were down there, we saw something unnatural. The worst bit is, it led right to the sinkhole here in Sandytown.",
  "ThreatReveal2_6": "You should be worried!",
  "ThreatReveal3_1": "Those weird tracks at the bottom of the pit? Those were the same tracks I saw at a town I used to live in. We didn't last more than a few months after we spotted those.",
  "ThreatReveal3_3": "Well, whatever made those tracks went for our supplies first.",
  "ThreatReveal4_2": "I’ll see ya there!",
  "ScoutEastGate_3": "Sure sounds worth takin’ a look.",
  "Devinah_8": "Like a shield?",
  "FarmSaved2_2": "By the look of ‘im, he’s probably fielded worse.",
  "GreatOakVillage_2": "That’s right, an' it’s a mighty nice spot you got here.",
  "GreatOakVillage_5": "I guess hidden and forgotten ain’t easy to find.",
  "TalkToDevinah_2": "Rarin’ to go. But hey, what's past those barricades?",
  "TalkToDevinah_5": "Whoa! That gust went straight to my bones!",
  "StillMoreToGo_6": "Hate to break up the architecture symposium, but that wasn’t the last of them!",
  "CornfieldNext_2": "On it!",
  "RingleaderThreatCleared_2": "Ya know, you’d get along real well with a leaf lovin’ friend of mine.",
  "StartJourneyToAncientForest_2": "I must admit, all this talk about forgotten forests has me curious.",
  "MonkeyMeadowNext_2": "Ah, sorry that was me.",
  "DownstreamNext_1": "These Bloons have a real grip on this part of the Forest.",
  "SpringSpringNext_1": "Phew! That was somethin’.",
  "MonkeyMeadowsCleared_1": "That was tricky! But the hairs on my neck ain’t standin’ anymore, so I think the meadow is clear. How ya feelin’ Dev?",
  "NewBloons_3": "It sure does look magical, and ancient. There’s a powerful quiet here.",
  "NewBloons2_1": "Wait for us! We need to follow her.",
  "BalanceNext_2": "But those tunnels change everything, and where Monkeys go, Bloons go.",
  "BalanceNext2_1": "Quick, after her!",
  "EnchantedGladeNext_2": "There’s an awful lot of trees here Devinah, you’ll have to be more specific.",
  "HeartOfTheForest_2": "More than welcome. Only thing is I don’t see any caves or sinkholes around here.",
  "HeartOfTheForest_10": "I reckon there’s only one way to find out.",
  "HeartOfTheForest_14": "Say no more, we understand.",
  "HeartOfTheForest2_2": "I’ll check our provisions, then meet you there.",
  "SureIsSpooky_1": "It is a might bit spooky in here.",
  "SureIsSpooky_5": "Don’t fret. I’m sure it’s nothin’.",
  "SureIsSpooky_7": "Buck up. Let’s go.",
  "GGhosts_2": "I hear ya, partner, but this is important. Now stand tall, ghosts ain’t real!",
  "GGhosts3_1": "There ain’t anything there, Scout.",
  "GGhosts3_3": "Devinah’s yarn is gettin’ the better of you is all.",
  "GGhosts4_1": "What in tarnation?!",
  "GGhosts4_2": "Get behind me!",
  "GGhosts4_4": "It’s not over yet, Scout, stay calm!",
  "WhatARelief_2": "An' now we know where the ghost stories came from. Devinah will get a laugh out of that.",
  "WhatARelief_4": "Getting through here might not be so bad after all!",
  "WhatsSoFunny_3": "Funny?",
  "WhatsSoFunny_5": "I… didn’t laugh.",
  "WhatsSoFunny_8": "Who’s there?",
  "WhatsSoFunny2_2": "Now we’re spookin’ ourselves. Come on, stay sharp. There’s still more of those Glass Bloons around.",
  "SickOfThisPlace_2": "Me too, but if there’s a clue about the tunnels, we need to find it.",
  "TheDeepSwamp_1": "This campfire doesn’t look too overgrown.",
  "TheDeepSwamp_3": "Maybe. No sign of tunnels though. We should keep looking.",
  "TheDeepSwamp_5": "We need to keep going, even if we’re scared. Pretty much the definition of bravery.",
  "CreepyMansion_1": "Whoa, what’s an old Mansion doing out here in the middle of a forest? Devinah didn’t say anything about this.",
  "CreepyMansion_5": "Not this again!",
  "CreepyMansion2_2": "Pretty sure it’s followin’ us.",
  "ShesFriendly_4": "Listen, if you really are a friend, can you answer a question of ours?",
  "ShesFriendly_6": "Have you seen a tunnel around here? One with lots of Bloons coming out of it?",
  "ShesFriendly_8": "Can you take us there?",
  "ShesFriendly_11": "Come on, Scout, she’s the best lead we’ve got.",
  "ArrivingAtTheCemetery_1": "How much further from here?",
  "EntranceToACavern_2": "Devinah was right. And this is the spittin’ image of the other caves.",
  "EntranceToACavern_5": "Then let’s deal with ‘em quick as we can.",
  "ACuriousGrave2_1": "What? Where did she go?",
  "ACuriousGrave2_3": "Hmmm…",
  "ACuriousGrave3_1": "Here lies our fearless hero. Styx, savior of the Town of Midnight.",
  "ACuriousGrave3_2": "The date’s from over a hundred years ago.",
  "ACuriousGrave3_4": "Wonder why she was lookin’ at it?",
  "ACuriousGrave3_5": "Anyhow, I’m not sure where our mysterious helper disappeared to, but we’d best take a look at this cave.",
  "TheTunnel3_2": "What’s that?",
  "TheTunnel3_4": "Hard to forget. I never saw anything. But I did hear it. The ground shook. There was a roar, then the earth just opened up, like a mouth swallowin’ everything above it.",
  "TheTunnel3_8": "No harm done. In fact, it helps.",
  "TheTunnel3_9": "When I was alone on the Frontier, I could only play it over and over in my mind. Talkin’ about it, though, is helpin’ me see it more clearly. So thank you, Scout.",
  "TheTunnel5_2": "She left a note behind.",
  "TheTunnel5_3": "All it says is, \"Thanks, it was fun.\"",
  "TheTunnel5_5": "It’s signed, too.",
  "TheTunnel5_6": "Oh…",
  "TheTunnel5_8": "It’s signed, Styx.",
  "TheTunnel5_12": "You are full of surprises, Scout. You were scared as a possum back there, but you meet a real ghost, and your laughin' your head off.",
  "TheTunnel7_2": "Hahaha.",
  "TheTunnel8_4": "Whaddya figure?",
  "TheTunnel8_6": "Well, I’m always up for a good mosey along the beach.",
  "MayorOffersToHelp2_3": "Following the tunnel clues. What are you doing all the way out here?",
  "MayorOffersToHelp3_1": "I’d say ‘no thanks’, but I know he’ll just keep running.",
  "MayorLocked_6": "Learning more every day, it seems.",
  "MayorLocked2_1": "Oh, no it’s fine Mr Mayor you really don’t have to. Really.",
  "MayorLocked2_6": "Thanks, Mr Mayor. I, uh, hope you get out of your house shortly.",
  "MayorLocked2_9": "Best of luck, Dirk. We’ll be movin’ on.",
  "AtTheCoast_2": "No settlin’ for now. We should start lookin’ around.",
  "MermonkeysAreReal_2": "A Mermonkey!? I thought they were just a myth.",
  "MermonkeysAreReal3_3": "I think I might just be seeing stuff.",
  "Maria_2": "I did, and it makes me think we might be out of our depth.",
  "Maria_4": "Can Bloons even breathe underwater?",
  "Maria_6": "So am I, but I can’t hold my breath that long! But maybe we don’t have to. There’s a boat over yonder.",
  "RideMaria_1": "There’s something etched on the side. It says ‘Maria’.",
  "RideMaria_3": "That makes a lot more sense.",
  "RideMaria_5": "Off to the deep blue we go!",
  "SpiceIslandsNext_1": "Looky here. Mr Mayor must've left his Water Pistol on Maria.",
  "SpiceIslandsNext_3": "And it's under attack! If we want ‘em to be more than just a story, we need to go!",
  "WaitComeBack3_2": "What do I know about Mermonkeys? Sure looked on edge, though. Maybe we can follow ’em from a distance?",
  "WaitComeBack3_4": "It looks like they headed up that platform yonder. Let’s head that way.",
  "MoreRetributionBloons2_2": "Didn’t think I’d ever see a Mermonkey, let alone try savin’ one. Let’s go!",
  "DidntNeedHelp_4": "Hey, let’s just simmer down.",
  "DidntNeedHelp_5": "All we want to know is if you’ve seen an unnatural tunnel around here, maybe the source of a passel of new Bloons? If it’s underwater you might be the only one to have seen it.",
  "DidntNeedHelp_13": "Please, this is important. We need to put a stop to the damage this thing can do.",
  "DidntNeedHelp_17": "Your home? That tunnel is that close to where you live?",
  "DidntNeedHelp_20": "Same here. We only need to know the tunnel’s whereabouts, then we’ll leave you alone.",
  "WhatMermonkeys_5": "Hey, Scout, perhaps a bit more scoutin’ and a bit less askin’.",
  "Peninsula_3": "Don’t worry about us - we’ll give ‘em what for.",
  "FightsNotOverYet_2": "How’s the homefront?",
  "FightsNotOverYet_4": "I’m glad to hear it, but looks like there’s more trouble up ahead.",
  "ProtectMermonkeyHome_2": "You said it. But I do have to add 'fighting alongside a Mermonkey' to the list of things I’m strugglin’ to believe is real.",
  "ProtectMermonkeyHome_5": "Scout, play twenty questions later, would ya? We have to focus. Where to now, Khai?",
  "ProtectMermonkeyHome_8": "‘Focus’ is that word we just mentioned.",
  "LuminousCoveNext_2": "We have to be part of this!",
  "HeresTheTunnel_2": "Whew, this tunnel is way too close.",
  "HeresTheTunnel_4": "It won’t come to that, we’ll put a stop to whatever's causing this.",
  "HeresTheTunnel2_7": "There was a secret shortcut the whole time?",
  "ClearingTheWay2_1": "Mermonkey magic? That looked like dynamite.",
  "ClearingTheWay2_3": "Thanks Khai, this will be much faster!",
  "WhereToNext_2": "You read my mind!",
  "WhereToNext2_2": "Don’t you go burnin’ yourself now!",
  "WhereToNext2_4": "Sounds good, I’ll see you soon!",
  "MountainPath_1": "Howdy, Scout. What’s the plan?",
  "MountainPath_3": "I’m going to be in such good shape after all this traversing! Lead the way!",
  "MountainPathBlocked_2": "Is there any other way up?",
  "MountainPathBlocked_6": "That was awful close.",
  "MountainPathBlocked2_7": "Hang on, Scout. He might be able to tell us who the mountain guide is.",
  "MountainPathBlocked3_1": "Hey, would you know where we can find the mountain guide?",
  "MountainPathBlocked3_3": "I ASKED IF YOU KNOW WHERE WE CAN FIND THE MOUNTAIN GUIDE!",
  "MountainPathBlocked3_10": "WE WERE JUST SAYIN’ WE’D REALLY APPRECIATE IT!",
  "DiamondInTheRough_2": "WE CAN HANDLE OURSELVES!",
  "ContinueUpTheMountain_3": "Nothin’ wrong with bein’ a little unhinged.",

  "ContinueUpTheMountain2_1": "THANKS, ROCKO!",
  "ContinueUpTheMountain3_1": "WAS THAT NECESSARY!? THE PATH’S ALREADY OPEN!",
  "AlpineRunNext_2": "THANKS! SOUNDS LIKE WE ALSO NEED TO CHECK OUT ALPINE RUN! YOU GO ON AHEAD!",
  "AlpineRunNext2_1": "ARE YOU COLLECTING ANY USEFUL… sorry. Are you collecting useful information?",
  "GoinUp_5": "Which means there’ll definitely be a tunnel around here.",
  "GoinUp_11": "That sounds terrible.",
  "MountainResort_5": "WHERE IS THIS MOUNTAIN VILLAGE!",
  "PostSkates_2": "Mine too, I’ll never be able to talk to another Monkey ever again at this rate.",
  "PostFrozen_2": "Rocko already ran off. We need to catch up.",
  "DarkPath2_1": "I feel like I got into the wrong profession. Blowin’ stuff up all the time seems pretty fun.",
  "ToGlacialTrail3_1": "Didn’t realize blowin’ up some rocks was a blessing.",
  "ErosionNext_1": "A campfire up here?",
  "ErosionNext_3": "Sounds like our best lead. There's too many crevasses up here, we could get lost if we went around checkin’ all of them.",
  "WheresThisTunnel_2": "Still no sign of a tunnel though.",
  "WheresThisTunnel_4": "I SAID THERE’S NO SIGN OF THE TUNNEL WE’RE LOOKING FOR!",
  "WheresThisTunnel3_1": "You a fan of his explosions now, Scout?",
  "BellyOfTheBeast3_2": "Good thing we got a guide, eh Scout?",
  "TheLostCrevasse_1": "This place sure is big.",
  "TheLostCrevasse2_1": "I guess we should follow him. The walls here feel quite fragile, and loud mouth over there isn’t the most subtle Monkey we’ve ever met.",
  "CrevasseBattle_2": "Seems too late for that!",
  "ThreatGrowsNear3_1": "It’s okay Scout. Did you get all the notes?",
  "ThreatGrowsNear3_3": "Alright, we should get out of here before any more Bloons decide to show up.",
  "OutsideAgain_4": "You’re alright Scout, we made it in one piece.",
  "OutsideAgain_5": "By the way Rocko. Oh right.",
  "OutsideAgain_6": "HEY, ROCKO! THANKS FOR HELPIN’ US!",
  "EndOfActThree_5": "Oh for suuure!",
  "EndOfActThree_8": "Beyond Sunset Gulch?",
  "EndOfActThree_14": "Sounds good. I’ll get ready and see you there.",
  "JourneyToTemple2_3": "You met them last night? And you thought that was a good idea to give them the keys to your house?",
  "JourneyToTemple2_6": "Right you are, let’s go.",
  "TheTemple_4": "Forward’s the best way to get anywhere, let’s go.",
  "InsideTheTemple_2": "That’s one big Snake!",
  "InsideTheTemple_5": "Get ready everyone! This thing looks angry!",
  "NotStoppingHere_2": "And that tunnel leads back to Sandytown!",
  "NotStoppingHere_4": "Here’s the plan. Scout and I will try to cut it off. Dirk, Hazel, you two go back to Sandytown with the Mayor. Stand guard in case it gets there before we can.",
  "NotStoppingHere_10": "Thanks Hazel.",
  "NotStoppingHere_12": "Thanks Dirk.",
  "ThroughMountain_1": "Rocko!",
  "ThroughMountain_2": "Oh. ROCKO!",
  "ThroughMountain_4": "WE’RE GOING BACK TO THE TUNNEL IN LOST CREVASSE! CAN YOU HELP US?!",
  "ThroughMountain_6": "WE’LL EXPLAIN ON THE WAY!",
  "ThroughMountain2_1": "EVERYONE READY?",
  "CrevasseReturn_4": "We’ll have to save the proper reunions for later, get ready everyone!",
  "OnItsTail_1": "It’s getting away again!",
  "OnItsTail2_6": "KEEP A LOOK OUT FOR US HERE ROCKO! IN CASE IT COMES BACK!",
  "OnItsTail3_2": "Some Monkeys never change, eh?",
  "DevinahAtYourSide2_2": "Everyone else as well, I don’t know if we could've done this alone.",
  "HelpFromGrave_3": "It’s coming closer!",
  "BackUnderground_2": "Scout?",
  "BackUnderground_4": "There’s no time! Come on, it’ll be headed straight to the cave under Sulfur Springs next. It could get to Sandytown before we know it!",
  "BackUnderground_5": "Thanks for your help Devinah. Please make sure Great Oak Village is safe.",
  "EndOfTheRoad_1": "Almost had it!",
  "EndOfTheRoad_4": "We need to go, now!",
  "FinalStand_1": "Is everyone okay!?",
  "FinalStand6_1": "Everyone!",
  "WeDidIt_1": "...",
  "WeDidIt3_3": "That’s right, Dirk. It was all you.",
  "WeDidIt7_2": "Strange. I have mixed feelings, but I’m glad the Diamondback is gone for good.",
  "WeDidIt7_4": "And I’d probably still be wandering the Frontier!",
  "WeDidIt7_6": "Thanks, Scout.",
  "WeDidIt8_2": "Always happy to pop one back with ya, partner.",
  "MayorDialogue1": "Howdy. I'm the Mayor!",
  "MayorDialogue2": "Still the Mayor!",
  "MayorDialogue3": "You trying to become the Mayor? Too bad, that's me!",
  "MayorDialogue4": "Welcome to my town! Mine... Not yours",
  "AmbushInSandyTown_8": "AHH!!",
  "AmbushInSandyTown2_1": "Why won't they leave us ALONE?!",
  "AmbushInSandyTown3_2": "Well, I was just having a tasty snack I found under this barrel, when I saw some Bloons break past the barricades! They’re somewhere in town!",
  "AmbushInSandyTown3_4": "This isn't the time to be arguing over the custody chain of snacks! We’re under attack!",
  "AmbushInSandyTown3_6": "Ah! Yes! All of us, yes! Oh! I think I saw a Bloon over there! I’ll go take care of that one!",
  "AmbushInSandyTown4_2": "Oh! Banana cookies!!",
  "TownIsSaved2_1": "That was -munch munch- incredible! -munch munch- AMAZ -munch- ING!",
  "TownIsSaved2_3": "Ah, right, sorry.",
  "TownIsSaved2_4": "What’s your -munch- name, sonny?",
  "TownIsSaved2_6": "Ah! Straight to business, you must have seen our ads. Bold to presume you can just take the job without even asking!",
  "TownIsSaved2_7": "But I like your style - very direct. You’re hired!",
  "TownIsSaved2_9": "Ha, ha, and a charming sense of humor as well! Charisma and leadership, what a find! Come on, Sheriff. Let me show you your new lodgings.",
  "TownIsSaved3_1": "Sheriff Sheriff, haha. That kid is funny.",
  "LeftBehind0_1": "Everyone! Over here!",
  "LeftBehind_1": "Ah! Look here everyone! The new Sheriff I just hired, isn't he wonderful? I told you those ads I spent all our crop money on was worth it.",
  "LeftBehind_2": "These genius budgetary moves are why you should all keep voting for me!",
  "LeftBehind_5": "Hoo hoo! Ah, right on time, Sheriff Sheriff! Here's your vacant homestead that belonged to the previous Sheriff, who left completely unharmed and of his own accord!",
  "LeftBehind_6": "I heard it mentioned that he felt bored because this town was too safe.",
  "LeftBehind_8": "No, please, no rumors based on false hearings. The word he kept using was blessed.",
  "LeftBehind_10": "Inside you'll find just enough space for you and your posse! You can change your outfit, select a critter companion, or rest up after a scuffle. This very Homestead is the best and fastest place to recover any lost Stamina.",
  "LeftBehind_11": "Go on in and check it out, don’t be shy! I think the old Sheriff left one of his hats behind. Being so kind and generous, I think you should have it for helping us with that little.. uh.. incident earlier!",
  "LeftBehind_13": "Oh, you must see the Saloon!",
  "TheSaloon_1": "Ah, Sandytown's Saloon! We get visitors from all over coming here to taste our famous cactus juice.",
  "TheSaloon_2": "The Saloon is the place to find Bloon-popping comrades, if you’ve got enough Bananite to make it worth their while, that is!",
  "TheSaloon_4": "OH OH OH! You NEED to see the general store!! It has so much stuff, all at occasionally reasonable prices!!",
  "TheSaloon_6": "I do like to listen, thank you for noticing! Now do follow along.",
  "TheGeneralStore_1": "This is where I procured this very hat just last week! Special Mayors discount for me, of course, but you'll get the everyday low, low normal price.",
  "TheGeneralStore_3": "Of course you can! The whole town runs on Bananite. Spend it wisely and freely!",
  "TheGeneralStore_5": "Oh boy, would you look at the sun! I’ve got my daily barrel inspection! Why don't you explore around town and meet me at my house later? I have an extra special task for you to really earn your keep!",
  "WatersOfSandytown_1": "Sheriff! How are things getting on!",
  "WatersOfSandytown_3": "That's good to hear. So as for that task! I've been personally asked to help with a fish population study by the Monkey Knowledge Society. For every fish I catch or inspire the catching of, I get a small compensation!",
  "WatersOfSandytown_5": "Precisely! I’ll even split the reward with you fifty fifty! Even though I’m doing most of the work. Cataloguing is very strenuous, you know.",
  "WatersOfSandytown_6": "Head down to the fishing spot on the edge of town and try out this rod I found laying by the shoreline. Almost as if it was left there by some unsung benefactor who knew you'd need it. The world is so mysterious and wonderful!",
  "WatersOfSandytown_8": "This is, um, a test! I just want to make sure you're able to survive out in the Frontier!",
  "WatersOfSandytown_10": "Good luck!!",
  "FishingDone_1": "Did you find the fishing hole? All I’ve fished up was a Bloonchipper. What a hunk of junk! You know what, you can keep that rod, for the good of Monkey Knowledge!",
  "FishingDone2_2": "Oh, would you look at the time! I have urgent barrel inspections to perform. Good luck, {SHERIFF_NAME}!",
  "ToColorfulTown_2": "Not again!!!",
  "BazaarTradingPost_2": "Just let me enjoy my day off at this exotic locale, you pesky Bloons!",
  "TheresMore_2": "There's still some over here, {SHERIFF_NAME}!",
  "ResortSaved_2": "What a relief! Thank you {SHERIFF_NAME}! I could've dealt with them myself of course, but you should never work on your day off!",
  "ResortSaved_5": "I would invite you to stay at this delightful resort with me, but you seem far too busy! You've earned a Deputy Badge {SHERIFF_NAME}! Good luck!",
  "ThreatReveal_2": "Ah, my boy! Entirely immersed in the new role, are we?",
  "ThreatReveal_4": "Ah, a serious conversation is it? Let’s go talk somewhere more serious then.",
  "ThreatReveal2_2": "What’s on your mind, son?",
  "ThreatReveal2_5": "The sinkhole? We put a fence around that ages ago! No need to worry about that.",
  "ThreatReveal3_2": "Coincidence! Sandytown is perfectly safe! You saw the ads!",
  "ThreatReveal3_4": "No! NOT THE BARRELS!!! There's precious cargo in there! Delicious, delicious, precious cargo.",
  "ThreatReveal3_6": "Splendid plan! I was just about to suggest that myself!",
  "ThreatReveal3_8": "Most certainly! Right after lunch!",
  "MayorOffersToHelp2_2": "Boys! So good to see you! What are you doing all the way out here?",
  "MayorOffersToHelp2_4": "Oh! Yes! I’d forgotten all about that! I hired Dirk to escort me out to my Vacation home. I needed to collect more salt for my famous salted sage cookies!",
  "MayorOffersToHelp2_5": "Say, while you’re here I’ll give you a taste! I haven’t been here in many months but I made extras last time I was here. They’re still in the storage container in the house, just you wait!",
  "MayorLocked_2": "I’ve given it some thought, my friends, and now that I’ve come all this way I think I’ll accompany you on your travels! Where are we headed?",
  "MayorLocked_4": "Marvelous!!! You know me and the Coast go way back! When I was a younger Monkey I used to travel all over the sea with Maria, hoo hoo!",
  "MayorLocked_7": "Ahhh, you should’ve seen it! Just us and the deepest blues.",
  "MayorLocked_8": "I’ll quickly grab my coat and be right with you! Dirk you can head off now, us heroes are off on an adventure!",
  "MayorLocked2_2": "Oh. Oh dear.",
  "MayorLocked2_3": "It seems I’ve somehow locked myself inside.",
  "MayorLocked2_5": "Best you go on ahead without me. I’ll catch up as soon as I can!",
  "MayorLocked2_7": "Yes, yes, I’ll be right behind you! Dirk, I am in need of your services again!",
  "MayorLocked2_10": "Oh, Dirk, buddy! This lock is really stuck! We might be here a while!",
  "EndOfActThree_1": "Hello, fellow adventurers! Sorry about that incident earlier. Good thing is that it only took Dirk two days to get that lock unstuck! What a nice fella, did it all for free, too!",
  "EndOfActThree_3": "He said he was going back up to Sunset Gulch. Something about “Feeling sorry for me” and saying I was a “goofball” whatever all that means!",
  "EndOfActThree_4": "Anyway, how did your travels go? I’m sure you missed my fighting expertise on your journey!",
  "EndOfActThree_10": "The Temple! That old thing?",
  "EndOfActThree_11": "Dirk’s up that way! I think I’ll go find him now. We became close friends stuck on that beach together you know, he must miss me!",
  "JourneyToTemple_1": "Good, everyone’s here!",
  "JourneyToTemple_3": "I also got to tell my new best friend how much I missed him!",
  "JourneyToTemple_6": "Thank you!",
  "JourneyToTemple2_2": "Oh a few people I met at the Saloon last night said they'd watch all my stuff. They pinky swore to take care of it all!",
  "JourneyToTemple2_4": "Oh, don’t be so skeptical {SHERIFF_NAME}. They pinky swore!",
  "TempleOverlook_4": "This is, um, quite high up! I didn’t know that you could be this far from the rest of the ground. Perhaps we should move on.",
  "TheTemple_2": "Oh there sure are a lot of them. You know what? I’m going to stand guard here! Yes! Guard the way back!",
  "EnterTheTemple_3": "Oh I just remembered, I forgot to douse my fireplace before I left!",
  "EnterTheTemple_5": "Oh! Yes, that’s right. I guess I can stay. I’ll cover the entrance!",
  "FinalStand2_1": "Hey! You stay away from my barrels! I already lost most of my stuff yesterday in an unforeseeable home invasion, and I’m not about to lose anything else!",
  "WeDidIt2_1": "Come come, everyone gather round!",
  "WeDidIt3_1": "I’ll say that was some mighty fine Bloon wrangling from everyone!",
  "WeDidIt3_4": "Thanks to you all, our lovely Sandytown is in one piece!",
  "WeDidIt3_5": "And a very special thanks to our Sheriff! Who I found to save our Sandytown. In honor of him, I’m starting a new family tradition called Nominative Determinism!",
  "WeDidIt3_6": "I’d say this calls for a full round of cactus juice, ON THE HOUSE!",
  "WeDidIt4_1": "AND THEN I SAID, THAT’S NOT A DART MONKEY, THAT’S A DART FISH!",
  "WeDidIt4_3": "HOO HOO HOO!",
  "ScoutDialogue1": "Hello {SHERIFF_NAME}!",
  "ScoutDialogue2": "Ready to move out?",
  "ScoutDialogue3": "Hey {SHERIFF_NAME}, it's me! Scout!",
  "ScoutDialogue4": "You haven't forgotten me right?",
  "MonkeyFound_1": "Get back! This dart is razor sharp!",
  "Surprised_1": "I’m not scared of you! Take that!",
  "Surprised_2": "Ack - I missed!",
  "Surprised2_1": "Hey now, I didn’t really mean to throw a dart at you, just a slip of the wrist you know? Haha!",
  "Surprised2b_1": "Wah! Where’d you come from!",
  "Surprised2b_3": "Y-yes?",
  "Surprised2b_5": "Oh!",
  "Surprised3_1": "Whew! Thank you, stranger!",
  "Surprised3_3": "Oh boy, where do I start?!",
  "Surprised3_4": "So our Mayor’s had a real sweet tooth for banana cookies lately, but he's eating everyone else's cookies!",
  "Surprised3_5": "I tried to hide them but Mr Mayor's nearly as good a scout as me! So I've started hiding mine out here.",
  "Surprised3_6": "I came to check on 'em, but before I knew it, it got dark! And, well, you saw the rest.",
  "Surprised3_7": "I know we just met, but you wouldn’t mind walking me back to Sandytown would you? I only had that one dart with me.",
  "Surprised3_9": "Thank you, stranger. It's just south of here, we can get to it by following the trail.",
  "BlockedPath_1": "Oh no, the trail’s blocked! It wasn't like this when I came out here.",
  "BlockedPath_3": "No, this is the only way through. The rocks look like they’ve been blasted loose.",
  "BlockedPath2_1": "Ah! It must've been Dynamite Bloons!",
  "BlockedPath2_3": "You don’t know?  They've been showing up in droves around here. They’re not like regular Bloons either, they explode after being hit!",
  "BlockedPath2_6": "Ooh, good idea! I’ll, uh, take cover.",
  "BlockedPath4_1": "Whoa! Good shot!",
  "BlockedPath4_3": "Let’s get movin’ before any more turn up.",
  "AmbushInSandyTown_1": "*Whew* home at last...",
  "AmbushInSandyTown_2": "I didn’t realise I’d been out so long, the sun’s already coming up.",
  "AmbushInSandyTown_3": "Thanks for getting me outta there. I still can’t believe that Bloon stole my snack.",
  "AmbushInSandyTown_5": "Well, I should probably get going. I have a lot to do today!",
  "AmbushInSandyTown_7": "Sure thing. Got some just over yonder.",
  "AmbushInSandyTown_9": "Whoa! That sounded like Mr Mayor!",
  "AmbushInSandyTown3_3": "Hey, those are mine!",
  "AmbushInSandyTown4_3": "Hey! Get your grubby hands off those!! They’re spoken for!",
  "TownIsSaved3_3": "I think you got a job. Cookie…?",
  "LeftBehind_4": "What did he say about our crop money?",
  "LeftBehind2_1": "Aaaand he's off.",
  "LeftBehind2_3": "Oh, and before I forget. Here's your new badge!",
  "FishingDone2_1": "Hey, my fishing rod! Where did you find it?",
  "FishingDone3_1": "Ah, I see the Mayor put you up to it. It’s fine, you can keep it. I can tell you’ll get good use out of it.",
  "FishingDone3_3": "He can be a lot, but he means well.",
  "FishingDone3_4": "By the way, a friend of mine told me at the Saloon last night there was some trouble brewing in Boulder Falls.",
  "FishingDone3_5": "Could you come and meet me up by the north entrance of town past the Saloon?",
  "FirstAssignment_1": "Howdy, {SHERIFF_NAME}. Thanks for coming.",
  "FirstAssignment_3": "Lots of them in Boulder Falls. I'll remove the barricade. Follow me!",
  "DirkQuickshot_1": "It's right up the trail from here. My friend should be here any minute.",
  "DirkQuickshot2_4": "Dirk’s one of the sharpest shots around. At least that's what he said over a few cactus juices.",
  "DirkQuickshot2_7": "You two have this all sorted, I’ll leave you to it!",
  "ClearedTheRidge_1": "Whoa, you two cleared this place out in no time!",
  "ClearedTheRidge2_1": "And what will the spotlight do without him? Anyway, now that it's just us, I was hoping to ask you something.",
  "ClearedTheRidge2_3": "I was headed up to Sunset Gulch myself, as there’s somethin' I need to look into. I was wonderin’ if you’d meet me there, since, well, you're good at keepin' me outta trouble.",
  "ClearedTheRidge2_4": "Might be worth heading back to Sandytown and checking if any new Monkeys are in the Saloon. Making more friends helps a lot with all this fighting.",
  "ClearedTheRidge2_6": "I'm glad he’s on our side! Well, mostly glad. See ya up there!",
  "OldRailroad_1": "{SHERIFF_NAME}! Glad you made it.",
  "OldRailroad_4": "Listen, can you two cover me for a bit? There’s something I need to check at the edge of the Gulch.",
  "OldRailroad_6": "Alrighty then you two, let’s get going!",
  "ALittleFurther_2": "Not really. I was hoping I might find something like a source, a place they might be coming from.",
  "ALittleFurther_6": "Alright heroes, let’s go!",
  "FindAnything2_2": "No. I can only tell the vague direction they came from, but nothin’ else.",
  "FindAnything2_6": "She's a Beast Handler. Great tracking skills.",
  "FindAnything2_9": "You’re right, I can’t believe I didn’t think of that!",
  "FindAnything3_1": "He likes the sound of his own name, but he’s good at what he does.",
  "FindAnything3_3": "Let’s head back down the ridge. Hazel sometimes hangs out near the Trading Post, so we should check there first.",
  "ToColorfulTown_1": "It's just across the river here! Be careful on the rocks, they’re slippery.",
  "ToColorfulTown_3": "Oh, heck, that's Mr Mayor! Let's giddy up!",
  "BazaarTradingPost_1": "There's Bloons attacking the Trading Post, we must've missed some!",
  "ResortSaved_3": "I asked around, but Hazel isn’t here anymore. Apparently she was headed towards Sulfur Springs though, so let’s head that way.",
  "ResortSaved_4": "We need to pass through Sandytown to get there, so it'd be a good time to stock up on supplies if you need any.",
  "BloonTracking_1": "Is a tumbleweed still a tumbleweed if it’s not tumbling?",
  "BloonTracking_3": "I think you’re onto something there.",
  "BloonTracking2_1": "Ah, Hazel!",
  "BloonTracking3_2": "That leaf?",
  "BloonTracking4_2": "We’ll be more careful of haphazard leaf steppin’ in the future! Sorry to bother, Hazel. This is {SHERIFF_NAME}, the new Sheriff. We could use your help.",
  "BloonTracking4_3": "You see, Sandytown’s been having trouble with a bunch of Dynamite Bloons, and we reckon they might be coming from somewhere around here. We figured you’d be the one to talk to.",
  "BloonTracking4_5": "Hazel, could you take us there?",
  "BloonTracking6_2": "*Sniff sniff*",
  "BloonTracking6_3": "All I smell is cowmonkey.",
  "Streambed_2": "Ah what! Did I nearly step on a leaf again?",
  "HazelTracking2_2": "Eat sand!?",
  "HazelTracking3_4": "Maybe I'd be a better tracker if I ate dirt from time to time.",
  "HazelTracking3_6": "A few more of those and your name might’ve been Tracker!",
  "APattern3_1": "Her digestive tract is either perfect, or the worst in Monkey history. I’m not betting on which.",
  "FinalPush_7": "Well, glad you learned that lesson instead of me. I was about to do the same thing. How'd it taste?",
  "CaveFound_5": "I’ll, uh, move the barricade. Is this a bad time to mention I'm not fond of caves?",
  "TheCave_2": "You know, maybe we should head back up just to make sure we're in the right place.",
  "TheCave_4": "That actually makes me feel better, and simultaneously frustrated. Thanks, {SHERIFF_NAME}.",
  "CaveExplore2_2": "I don't know what's scarier, following a rock-eating Beast Handler or a Monkey who makes choices by flipping a coin. All in the dark.",
  "UndergroundChaos_1": "Why did it have to be in a cave? I can’t see a thing!",
  "UndergroundChaos2_1": "WAHHH!",
  "UndergroundChaos2_3": "What rock? There's thousands of rocks!",
  "UndergroundChaos3_2": "I say we go left!",
  "AClueFromThePast_2": "Thanks to you two, yes!",
  "AClueFromThePast2_1": "Oh whoa, look over there.",
  "AClueFromThePast3_1": "How on banana-blessed earth did this get here? It's like a giant tunnel, I can't even see to either end. It’s gigantic.",
  "AClueFromThePast3_3": "If Bloons are coming through here, it won’t be safe to follow it. We should get out of here before any more show up.",
  "AClueFromThePast3_5": "{SHERIFF_NAME}? Is everything alright?",
  "AClueFromThePast3_7": "You’re worried? Now I’m worried.",
  "AClueFromThePast4_1": "Hazel, thanks for your help.",
  "AClueFromThePast5_1": "Every Monkey to their own I guess.",
  "AClueFromThePast6_2": "Quicker way out sounds good to me!",
  "Shortcut_2": "Great! Let’s go!",
  "TownSinkhole_1": "Wait a minute, that tunnel leads here?",
  "TownSinkhole2_1": "Normally I’d check his house, but there are some barrels just up here.",
  "ThreatReveal3_5": "Now you mention it, a newcomer in the Saloon the other day was rattlin’ on about supply raids in Oak Valley. Maybe we should head through Furlong Fields and see if it's related.",
  "ThreatReveal3_7": "While we’re gone, can you wrangle up the townsfolk and make sure all the barricades are shored up?",
  "ThreatReveal4_1": "Let's head out soon as you’re ready. I’ll meet you by the east exit, towards Wagon’s Way.",
  "ScoutEastGate_1": "Howdy, {SHERIFF_NAME}! Hope you got some rest.",
  "ScoutEastGate_2": "I’ve organised to meet with Devinah along Wagon’s Way. She sent word that matched our situation so I reckon she’ll be able to help us find out more.",
  "ScoutEastGate_4": "I’ll move the barricade and we can get going.",
  "Devinah_1": "There she is. Hey, Devinah!",
  "Devinah_5": "The Ancient Forest?",
  "CoveredGardenNext_2": "Why didn’t I bring my duster?!",
  "StillMoreToGo_2": "You alright, Devinah?",
  "StillMoreToGo_4": "In hindsight, the rotating hole in the roof might leave ya occasionally exposed.",
  "SpringSpringNext_3": "I meant to ask, what’s so special about this place that the Druids all gather up here?",
  "SpringSpringNext_5": "Now that’s a Druid answer if I ever heard one!",
  "MonkeyMeadowsCleared_3": "That’s some power alright. The Bloons barely stand a chance against those thorn covered vines.",
  "MonkeyMeadowsCleared_5": "A lightning tornado? Not anywhere near me I hope!",
  "NewBloons_5": "Whoa wait, what was that?",
  "NewBloons2_2": "Right behind you.",
  "BalanceNext_3": "And Druids are here for Druids.",
  "EnchantedGladeNext2_1": "Let’s hurry and help!",
  "HeartOfTheForest_4": "Where?",
  "HeartOfTheForest_7": "G-g-ghosts!!?",
  "HeartOfTheForest_12": "Wait, you’re not coming with us?",
  "HeartOfTheForest2_1": "Guess we’d better get going as soon as you’re ready.",
  "IntoTheSwamp_1": "Alright, here we go.",
  "IntoTheSwamp2_1": "R-ready when you are.",
  "SureIsSpooky_2": "No kiddin’ My hackles are full up.",
  "SureIsSpooky_4": "W-what was that!?",
  "SureIsSpooky_6": "Y-yeah.",
  "SureIsSpooky_8": "Beautiful trees, she said.",
  "GGhosts_1": "Why’d our next l-lead have to be h-here of all pl-places?",
  "GGhosts2_1": "WAHHH!!",
  "GGhosts2_2": "There! There! I just saw one!",
  "GGhosts3_2": "I’m tellin’ you it was there, Sheriff!",
  "GGhosts4_3": "I can’t believe this is how it ends! The ghosts of all those popped Bloons have finally come to enact their revenge!",
  "WhatARelief_1": "Whew, what a relief! They weren't ghosts at all - just Bloons made of glass!",
  "WhatARelief_3": "It is pretty funny in hindsight.",
  "WhatsSoFunny_2": "What’s funny, Sheriff?",
  "WhatsSoFunny_4": "Didn’t you laugh just now?",
  "WhatsSoFunny_7": "Okay, this isn’t funny!",
  "WhatsSoFunny2_1": "I don’t like this, Sheriff.",
  "SickOfThisPlace_1": "I’m really startin’ to get sick of this place.",
  "SickOfThisPlace_3": "I know.",
  "TheDeepSwamp_2": "Maybe the plants and bugs are scared, too.",
  "TheDeepSwamp_4": "Can’t we stay here a little longer?",
  "CreepyMansion_2": "I don’t like it one little bit!",
  "CreepyMansion_4": "EEEEP!!",
  "CreepyMansion2_1": "I don’t hear anything anymore. Do you think it’s gone?",
  "CreepyMansion3_1": "EEEEEYYYAAHHH!!!",
  "CreepyMansion3_2": "Wh-who are you?! Wh-what do ya want with us?",
  "CreepyMansion3_4": "And we shouldn’t have come here!",
  "ShesFriendly_1": "So you’re helping us?",
  "ShesFriendly_3": "And those were z-zombie Bloons you were controlling?",
  "ShesFriendly_10": "She’s still c-creeping me out!",
  "ShesFriendly_12": "Oughhhhh…",
  "ArrivingAtTheCemetery_3": "Can’t you say that less… creepily?",
  "EntranceToACavern_3": "Then hopefully we find out somethin’ about it.",
  "ACuriousGrave2_2": "Maybe she doesn’t like caves?",
  "ACuriousGrave3_3": "I ain’t heard of the Town of Midnight before.",
  "TheTunnel_1": "There’s the tunnel! I’ll jot down some notes.",
  "TheTunnel3_1": "Hey, {SHERIFF_NAME}. I’ve been meanin’ to ask.",
  "TheTunnel3_3": "About the first tunnel, and your town. Anything else you remember?",
  "TheTunnel3_5": "Gosh, that sounds scary.",
  "TheTunnel3_6": "I’m sorry I made you recollect that. It’s just, we need to know as much as we can.",
  "TheTunnel3_7": "It’s pretty scary to think how big this thing might be, and whether we can do anything about it.",
  "TheTunnel3_10": "I appreciate it, Sheriff.",
  "TheTunnel4_2": "WAH! How did you do that?!",
  "TheTunnel5_1": "WAH! It’s just as scary when she disappears!",
  "TheTunnel5_4": "That’s it?",
  "TheTunnel5_7": "What is it!?",
  "TheTunnel5_9": "The name on the gravestone!",
  "TheTunnel5_10": "Wouldn’t that mean she’s a…?",
  "TheTunnel5_11": "Hahahaha!",
  "TheTunnel5_13": "Yep. Turns out ghosts ain't THAT scary. Some of 'em are downright helpful. Or just made of glass!",
  "TheTunnel6_1": "Thank you, Styx!",
  "TheTunnel6_2": "We had fun too!",
  "TheTunnel7_1": "Hahahaha.",
  "TheTunnel7_3": "Well, that's probably all the laughin’ this haunted tunnel in the Swamp can handle. Let me figure this out.",
  "TheTunnel8_1": "Hmm. Ah yep.",
  "TheTunnel8_2": "And carry the one...",
  "TheTunnel8_3": "Okay!",
  "TheTunnel8_5": "Based on the tunnels we’ve seen and where they seem to be headin’, I would say we should look at the The Coast next.",
  "TheTunnel8_7": "Let’s go back to the Swamp campfire, we can head out from there.",
  "CoastDestination_1": "I’m all set for supplies, {SHERIFF_NAME}, but feel free to head back to Sandytown if you need. Meet me at the barricades south of here, past Ancient Portal when you’re ready.",
  "MayorOffersToHelp_1": "If we follow this path we can get to the Coast. Wait, what are they doing here?",
  "MayorOffersToHelp3_3": "He does talk a lot, but he’s always high energy, ya know? What I wouldn’t give to be a happy chappy in my own little world like that.",
  "MayorLocked_3": "The clues are pushing us toward The Coast, so we were headin’ that way.",
  "MayorLocked_5": "Mr Mayor had a girlfriend?",
  "MayorLocked2_4": "How is that even possible?",
  "AtTheCoast_1": "Wow, it’s really pretty here. The kinda place you could settle down.",
  "MermonkeysAreReal_1": "Wait. Look there! Am I seeing things!? Is that a…?",
  "MermonkeysAreReal3_1": "Ah no, it left.",
  "MermonkeysAreReal3_2": "That’s amazing. I can’t believe it!",
  "MermonkeysAreReal3_4": "Whoa, watch out {SHERIFF_NAME}! Bloons incoming!",
  "Maria_1": "Hey, {SHERIFF_NAME}, did you notice the Bloons were coming from the water?",
  "Maria_3": "But the Bloons might not be. If the tunnels go deep enough, they could pass under the ocean.",
  "Maria_5": "Well, they are filled with air.",
  "Maria_7": "Wouldn’t it belong to someone, though? Are we pirates now?",
  "RideMaria_2": "Ohhh, Maria wasn’t Mr Mayor’s girlfriend, it was his boat’s name!",
  "RideMaria_4": "In that case I’m sure he wouldn’t mind us using it.",
  "SpiceIslandsNext_2": "These are the Spice Islands. I’ve heard about ‘em.",
  "WaitComeBack_1": "Look!",
  "WaitComeBack2_1": "Um, hello there!",
  "WaitComeBack2_3": "Ah, what? Following you?",
  "WaitComeBack2_5": "Ah wait! We had a question about something important!",
  "WaitComeBack3_1": "A Mermonkey would be really helpful for finding an underwater tunnel. How can we get ‘em to listen?",
  "WaitComeBack3_3": "Might as well try.",
  "MoreRetributionBloons_1": "There they are. Oh, that’s no good.",
  "MoreRetributionBloons2_1": "That’s an awful lot of Bloons.",
  "DidntNeedHelp_2": "So what I believe you were trying to say is ‘thank you.’",
  "DidntNeedHelp_8": "Yes, that’s the one!",
  "DidntNeedHelp_11": "Wait! Could you take us to the tunnel? Or tell us where it is? We need to find out more about it. Whatever it is, it’s troublin’ our town up north in the desert.",
  "DidntNeedHelp_15": "What’s that?",
  "DidntNeedHelp_19": "Well, I promise to keep it a secret!",
  "WhatMermonkeys_2": "Wait! I need to ask, can you really breathe underwater?",
  "WhatMermonkeys_4": "And is it true that you have sharp teeth?",
  "WhatMermonkeys_6": "Ah, you’re right. I’m just really excited.",
  "FightsNotOverYet_1": "Khai!",
  "ProtectMermonkeyHome_3": "By the way, what kind of food do you eat? Do you like bananas?",
  "ProtectMermonkeyHome_7": "Your home? Wow! How long have you all lived there? Do you have houses? Is it all wet?",
  "ProtectMermonkeyHome_9": "Sorry. I got excited!",
  "HeresTheTunnel2_1": "Alright, I’ve taken all the notes I can. Thanks for trusting us Khai.",
  "HeresTheTunnel2_3": "Scout’s honor.",
  "HeresTheTunnel2_5": "Back to the Coast for starters. I reckon we have a long boat journey ahead of us.",
  "HeresTheTunnel2_9": "Oh, that makes sense! Mind if I ask you a few questions on the way…?",
  "ClearingTheWay2_4": "Hope to see you again.",
  "WhereToNext_1": "Let me just dry off, that cove was so wet and damp.",
  "WhereToNext2_1": "Hot! Hot! Hot! I shouldn’t have stood so close!",
  "WhereToNext2_3": "Whew! That’s better. I’m going to look at my notes down by the water. Head back to Sandytown if you need to and meet me back near the boat dock later.",
  "MountainPath_2": "Howdy, {SHERIFF_NAME}. I think we’ll need to head to Frozen Peak. It’s quite a climb but there’s a mountain guide who can help us get up there.",
  "MountainPathBlocked_1": "Uh oh, the trail's blocked!",
  "MountainPathBlocked_3": "No, this is the only way. How’re we supposed to get up there now?",
  "MountainPathBlocked_5": "Wah! What’s happening!?",
  "MountainPathBlocked2_2": "What’s wrong with you? You almost blew us up!",
  "MountainPathBlocked2_4": "Hey! Did you hear what I said!?",
  "MountainPathBlocked2_6": "How rude! We don’t have time for this, let’s go {SHERIFF_NAME}, the trail’s clear now.",
  "MountainPathBlocked2_8": "If you wanna ask him, be my guest.",
  "MountainPathBlocked3_5": "That’s you!?",
  "MountainPathBlocked3_8": "It just can’t be!! This guy!?",
  "DiamondInTheRough_4": "At least if you’re here, we could sneak around ’em.",
  "ContinueUpTheMountain_2": "Are you sure this is a good idea? This guy seems unhinged.",
  "AtFrozenPeak_2": "Thanks. Oh. THANKS, ROCKO!",
  "AlpineRunNext2_2": "Sure am! Let’s head up and meet with Rocko. It seems too quiet now.",
  "GoinUp_1": "Whoa!",
  "GoinUp_2": "WHY ARE YOU BLOWING EVERYTHING UP!?",
  "GoinUp_6": "And we’re making progress.",
  "GoinUp_8": "I SAID WE’RE MAKING PROGRESS!",
  "MountainResort_1": "Looks like it hasn’t been used in… ever?",
  "MountainResort_3": "Yeah, I wonder why… oh wait! It’s freezing!",
  "MountainResort_7": "CAN’T IMAGINE WHY!",
  "PostFrozen_1": "That seems to be the last of them, at least in the main field anyway.",
  "PostFrozen_3": "He went back the way we came.",
  "DarkPath2_2": "It’s clear now, but lookin’ at it I wish it wasn’t.",
  "ToGlacialTrail3_2": "Who knew! We should do that more often!",
  "ErosionNext_2": "Rocko reckons there’s a part of the glacier that seems to be eroding faster than the others. Maybe it means more Bloon activity?",
  "ErosionNext_4": "OKAY, ROCKO! LEAD THE WAY!",
  "WheresThisTunnel_1": "Feels like we’re getting closer. Bloons being this far up the mountain doesn’t seem like a normal thing.",
  "WheresThisTunnel2_2": "I hadn’t even thought that the entrance could be covered in snow!",
  "WheresThisTunnel3_2": "Okay maybe I was a little too… critical earlier.",
  "BellyOfTheBeast3_1": "This has to be it!",
  "BellyOfTheBeast3_3": "More like a demolition expert!",
  "BellyOfTheBeast3_4": "We’ll need to be extra careful, though. We don’t know what’s down there.",
  "BellyOfTheBeast3_6": "JUST FOLLOW US AND TRY NOT TO CAUSE A CAVE IN!",
  "TheLostCrevasse_2": "Yeah, I think we should stick together.",
  "TheLostCrevasse2_2": "Heh, you can say that again.",
  "ThreatGrowsNear_1": "This is definitely it! I’ll take note of the tunnel’s position quickly.",
  "ThreatGrowsNear2_2": "EYYYAAHHH!",
  "ThreatGrowsNear2_3": "Oh could you BE QUIET FOR ONCE!?",
  "ThreatGrowsNear3_2": "Yeah, I’ve got everything I need.",
  "OutsideAgain_3": "Whew, that was a lot of Bloons, my legs won’t stop shaking!",
  "OutsideAgain_8": "Oh my poor ears. I’m ready to get back to warm and QUIET Sandytown!",
  "EndOfActThree_2": "Where is he now?",
  "EndOfActThree_6": "We’ve got some news about the tunnel.",
  "EndOfActThree_7": "Given the direction the tunnel is goin’, from here under the Town Sinkhole, under Sulfur Springs, through the Swamp and then past Frozen Peak… it’s likely continuin’ north.",
  "EndOfActThree_9": "If I had to put money on it, I’d say it’s likely to be near The Temple.",
  "EndOfActThree_12": "{SHERIFF_NAME}, it’s probably good to gather any supplies you might need before we go. Feels like we might be about to enter the belly of the beast.",
  "EndOfActThree_13": "Remember that old train station at the north end of Sunset Gulch where we fought the Bloons with Dirk? I’ll meet you there.",
  "JourneyToTemple_2": "As I was heading up to Sunset Gulch I ran into Hazel. She’s offered to help us.",
  "JourneyToTemple2_1": "Hey Mr Mayor, if you’re here then who’s watching Sandytown?",
  "JourneyToTemple2_5": "Sorry to interrupt but it’s time we head off, we can deal with this issue later.",
  "TempleOverlook_3": "And look at all those Bloons!",
  "TempleOverlook_6": "Well, either what we’re after is down there, or Rocko decided to try excavating the desert for a change.",
  "TheTemple_1": "Looks like we’ll need to clear all the Bloons swarming the Temple first, then we can head inside.",
  "EnterTheTemple_2": "The Bloons do seem to be growing in number, we must be close to the source.",
  "EnterTheTemple_6": "Alright, let’s go before any more of us lose our nerve. Stay close everyone!",
  "InsideTheTemple_1": "Eek! Is th-that what I think it is!?",
  "NotStoppingHere_1": "What! It’s getting away!",
  "NotStoppingHere_3": "We need to stop it!",
  "NotStoppingHere_7": "Good plan, {SHERIFF_NAME}. Let’s see if we can cut it off back at Glacial Trail. Given the shape of the tunnel, that’ll be where it’s headed next.",
  "NotStoppingHere_8": "Meet me by the campfire on Glacial Trail as soon as you can! And good luck, Dirk, Hazel!",
  "CrevasseReturn_1": "Khai!",
  "CrevasseReturn_3": "Boy, could we ever!",
  "CrevasseReturn_9": "I wouldn’t bother, he yells all the time. Your ears get used to it, eventually...",
  "OnItsTail_2": "But that means it’ll be headed to the Mermonkey’s Cove next!",
  "OnItsTail2_2": "THAT WE GOTTA MOVE!",
  "OnItsTail2_3": "We might be able to cut it off at the Swamp where that Crypt was, but we should also warn the villagers in Great Oak Village first!",
  "OnItsTail2_5": "WE DON’T HAVE TIME TO WAIT!",
  "DevinahAtYourSide_1": "Devinah! Devinah!",
  "DevinahAtYourSide_3": "We found what we were looking for, and it’s a ginormous Bloon critter headin’ straight for the Swamp!",
  "DevinahAtYourSide_5": "We came to warn you, there might be a lot of Bloons coming this way!",
  "DevinahAtYourSide2_1": "Whew, I feel better having Devinah join us.",
  "DevinahAtYourSide3_2": "We need to go to the Swamp.",
  "HelpFromGrave_2": "Uh oh!",
  "BackUnderground_3": "Sorry, I thought I saw…",
  "BackUnderground_7": "Let’s get to Sulfur Springs as soon as we can {SHERIFF_NAME}!",
  "UndergroundBoss_3": "It’s coming this way, an’ we need to cut it off! Do you remember the way through the cave Hazel?",
  "EndOfTheRoad_3": "On the ropes isn’t good enough! It’ll be headed right into Sandytown!",
  "FinalStand6_3": "Come on, Sheriff, let’s show these Bloons what Sandytown is made of!",
  "WeDidIt_2": "Did we…?",
  "WeDidIt_3": "Yes! We really did it!",
  "WeDidIt3_8": "Woohoo!",
  "WeDidIt7_1": "How’re you feelin’, {SHERIFF_NAME}?",
  "WeDidIt7_3": "Well, Sandytown will always be grateful you chose to stay when you did. There’s no telling what could have happened without you.",
  "WeDidIt7_5": "Regardless of what you choose to do now Sheriff, you’ll always have a home with us in Sandytown.",
  "WeDidIt8_1": "Well, I don’t know about you, but I could do with another cactus juice!",
  "DirkDialogue1": "What's going on?",
  "DirkDialogue2": "I'm feelin' sassy!",
  "DirkDialogue3": "I'm Quickshot. Dirk Quickshot",
  "DirkDialogue4": "Tumble with the tumbleweeds",
  "DirkQuickshot2_1": "So! You're the new Sheriff?",
  "DirkQuickshot2_3": "The name’s Quickshot. Dirk Quickshot.",
  "DirkQuickshot2_5": "Let’s not talk about the other night - I’m still feeling a bit prickly. Anyway the Bloons are swarmin' the end of the trail, like somethin’s whipped ‘em up. Even I can’t take ‘em on my own. Whaddya say, {SHERIFF_NAME}?",
  "FurtherOutbreaks_1": "That ain't close to all of 'em, but at least the main road is clear. Nice shootin' out there.",
  "FurtherOutbreaks_3": "Heh, I know.",
  "FurtherOutbreaks2_1": "Come on, more Bloons this way.",
  "Campfire_1": "Alright! That looks nice ‘n clear. Glad you could see me in action.",
  "Campfire_3": "Dirk the Berserk! Quarrelsome Quickshot! My name is known far and wide.",
  "Campfire_6": "There's a campfire not far from here, and what Monkey doesn’t love time 'round the campfire?",
  "Campfire2_1": "You can idle there to restore Stamina, or swap out Posse members low on Stamina with fresh Ranch Hands. The campfires out here even let you fast travel.",
  "Campfire2_3": "Somethin’ like that. Hey, I found this Dynamite Stick in a crate. You look like you need it more'n me. You can put it on at the Campfire. Follow 'long!",
  "CampfireAmbush_2": "Nah, don’t like tyin’ myself down anywhere, like the desert wind. But Sandytown treats me well, and the cactus juice always hits the spot, heh.",
  "CampfireAmbush_4": "That's right.",
  "CampfireAmbush_7": "Hah! Come back for another taste, did they? Momma always said going back for seconds is the best compliment you can give a Monkey!",
  "CampfireAmbush_8": "Hope you've got an appetite for hot lead!",
  "AlongTheRidge_1": "Done and dusted.",
  "AlongTheRidge_2": "Strange though, I coulda sworn we cleared them all out from the main road.",
  "AlongTheRidge_5": "Over there! There's more of ‘em up along that ridge and down near the Bazaar trading post.",
  "AlongTheRidge_6": "I'll head over now, meet me there when you can!",
  "BackAlongTheRidge_1": "Yeehaw! What a team we make with you backing me up! They’re on the run now!",
  "BackAlongTheRidge_3": "You're stealing my thunder, kid.",
  "ClearedTheRidge_2": "Sure did! Junior here is quite the Monkey!",
  "ClearedTheRidge_4": "That's no matter. They didn't stand a chance against Dirk the Daring and his new sidekick, {SHERIFF_NAME} the Sheriff!",
  "ClearedTheRidge_5": "Anyway, I must be off. I left something up at Sunset Gulch that needs tendin’ to. See ya!",
  "OldRailroad_3": "Howdy, {SHERIFF_NAME}. Good thing I came here when I did. Bunch of Bloons up here. Naturally I managed to single-handedly push 'em back up to the old railroad.",
  "SunsetGulch_1": "Alright, that's done. Let's see where Scout ran off to.",
  "ALittleFurther_4": "Well if it’s a source you're wantin’, I reckon we follow the fire!",
  "FindAnything_1": "Bullseye! Another notch for Dirk the Dangerous.",
  "FindAnything2_3": "Dagnabbit. There’s gotta be a way.",
  "FindAnything2_4": "Hey, you know Hazel, don’t ya Scout?",
  "FindAnything2_7": "Heh. Always scufflin' and scrabblin' 'round, eyes glued to the dirt. Good with animals though.",
  "FindAnything2_8": "I bet if there was even a hint of a trail, she'd be able to follow it.",
  "FindAnything2_10": "See you ‘round. If you ever need me, just give me a whistle.",
  "MayorOffersToHelp2_1": "{SHERIFF_NAME}, Scout.",
  "MayorOffersToHelp3_2": "Trust me I was hoping he’d run off on me. I’ve never met someone who talked so much.",
  "MayorOffersToHelp3_4": "Well, in any case, I need to follow him. I get paid by the dart, ya know, so hopefully there’s some Bloons on the way.",
  "MayorLocked_1": "You alright Mr Mayor? You’re lookin’ extra inspired.",
  "MayorLocked2_8": "Still here, Mr Mayor.",
  "JourneyToTemple_4": "Oh yeah, overjoyed to see you too buddy ol’ pal.",
  "TempleOverlook_1": "So, it’s down there huh?",
  "TempleOverlook_7": "Yeeeeeehaw!! Let’s get this rodeo on the road-eo!",
  "TheTemple_3": "What would we do without ya, buddy.",
  "EnterTheTemple_1": "Yeehaw! Now THAT was a good fight!",
  "EnterTheTemple_4": "I thought you had people watching your house. I’m sure they can handle it, right Mr Mayor?",
  "InsideTheTemple_3": "Don’t matter how big the Bloon is, I’ll take it down!",
  "NotStoppingHere_6": "An’ I can smell my legendary hero status already.",
  "NotStoppingHere_11": "Take this Peacepopper, you’ll get good use out of it.",
  "NotStoppingHere_13": "Now get outta here you two!",
  "UndergroundBoss_2": "If you two are here, then…",
  "UndergroundBoss_5": "Round two it is! Only way I’m goin’ down is with my guns blazin’!",
  "EndOfTheRoad_2": "Heh, I’d say we’ve got it on the ropes!",
  "FinalStand3_1": "Yeeeehaw! Get ready to eat lead ya rubbery rats!",
  "WeDidIt3_2": "Well naturally it was no match for me!",
  "WeDidIt5_1": "So you’re the famous Styx, foe of all Bloons?",
  "WeDidIt5_3": "Of course it’s only natural that two legends across time would meet like this! What advice would you give a fellow hero?",
  "WeDidIt5_5": "Heh, I knew you’d get it!",
  "HazelDialogue1": "Ooh what's that?",
  "HazelDialogue2": "A fine piece of gravel for my collection!",
  "HazelDialogue3": "Hey {SHERIFF_NAME}. Lookin' good!",
  "HazelDialogue4": "Can I pet that dog?",
  "BloonTracking3_1": "You should be careful, you almost stepped on that leaf.",
  "BloonTracking3_3": "Yes, that specific leaf.",
  "BloonTracking4_1": "See these tracks? Means some Aura bloons have been nearby. Round, floaty, sunny things, you know? I only know because of this leaf, and you almost stepped on it!",
  "BloonTracking4_4": "Well you've come to the right Monkey. I saw some Dynamite Bloon tracks not too long ago.",
  "BloonTracking4_6": "Yes, yes I can. Now let’s see which way they went.",
  "BloonTracking5_1": "*Sniff sniff*",
  "BloonTracking5_2": "Yes, it was this way. They were here only an hour ago. Follow me.",
  "Streambed_1": "WAIT!",
  "Streambed_3": "No, the tracks continue through here, but we need to clear these Bloons first.",
  "HazelTracking_1": "Be still.",
  "HazelTracking3_1": "Mhm, I thought so. Bloons ahead, Dynamite Bloons, too.",
  "HazelTracking3_3": "Yes. The dust’s finer, as if swept over, and I tasted gunpowder.",
  "HazelTracking3_7": "This way, this way.",
  "HazelTracking4_1": "There are more Bloons up ahead, we should be on our guard.",
  "APattern_2": "Hmmmm, where to indeed? *Crunch crunch*",
  "APattern2_1": "Yes, they definitely went this way.",
  "APattern2_2": "Keep your eyes peeled, there's more Bloons up ahead.",
  "FinalPush_1": "Well, that was fun. Let me look around and see if I can keep following their tracks.",
  "FinalPush_3": "This should be good!",
  "FinalPush_6": "If you’d have looked down, there are scorch marks on the ground, clearly south! You don't always need to eat the dirt. Sometimes your eyes do the trick.",
  "FinalPush_9": "I guess you got it half right! You might have what it takes to be a tracker one day, {SHERIFF_NAME}.",
  "CaveFound_1": "Here we are.",
  "CaveFound_3": "This cave is pretty dark, you sure we want to head in?",
  "CaveFound_7": "And my stick!",
  "TheCave_1": "Sure is dark in here. I'm glad we've got your light, {SHERIFF_NAME}!",
  "CaveExplore_2": "Everything tastes the same down here.",
  "UndergroundChaos2_2": "Watch where you're going! You made me drop my rock!",
  "UndergroundChaos2_4": "Exactly. How am I supposed to find it now?",
  "AClueFromThePast3_2": "It's definitely not natural - I can taste it.",
  "AClueFromThePast4_2": "Certainly! Let me know if you need my help for-",
  "AClueFromThePast4_3": "Oooh, are those stalactites?",
  "AClueFromThePast6_3": "Hey! I found my rock!",
  "JourneyToTemple_5": "*Sniff sniff* the weird guy with the big hat smells like bananas and sugar.",
  "TempleOverlook_2": "*Sniff sniff* Something smells off about this place!",
  "TheTemple_5": "This dirt tastes even stranger. I’m not sure what we’re facing here but I don’t like it.",
  "InsideTheTemple_4": "It smells terrible! I bet it tastes terrible, too.",
  "NotStoppingHere_5": "I’ll be able to smell it a mile away!",
  "NotStoppingHere_9": "Take this pebble for good luck!",
  "UndergroundBoss_1": "Uh-oh.",
  "UndergroundBoss_4": "Down, right, don’t go left yet, then go left, then don’t go left because that leads somewhere far away, and don’t go right at the… actually, after saying it out loud, it’ll just be easier if I lead the way.",
  "FinalStand3_2": "I’m gonna wipe out this bad smell!",
  "DevinahDialogue1": "Everyone rested?",
  "DevinahDialogue2": "We've got this!",
  "DevinahDialogue3": "Hi {SHERIFF_NAME}!",
  "DevinahDialogue4": "We must trust nature",
  "Devinah_2": "Ah, good to see you Scout, and it’s nice to meet you too, {SHERIFF_NAME}. Thank you both for coming.",
  "Devinah_3": "Scout may have told you, but I think we’re having similar issues in the valley to what you described.",
  "Devinah_4": "Considering what I know, I believe it’s coming from the Ancient Forest.",
  "Devinah_6": "It’s a forest lost to time, hidden upstream off a little pass in Monkey Meadows. I’ll accompany you both there.",
  "Devinah_7": "Just keep your wits about you. The main cause of disturbance for us have been the Ringleader Bloons, which whip up strong winds that protect them.",
  "Devinah_9": "Yes, of sorts. If we do encounter any, don’t let up your attacks. We should be able to get through them with persistent offense.",
  "FurlongFields_1": "Oh no! The Bloons invading Great Oak Village are here!",
  "FurlongFields_2": "We can’t pass by and do nothing. {SHERIFF_NAME}, Scout, can you help me save the farm?",
  "FarmSaved_1": "Whew, good to see you’re alright there, Farmer McWheaty.",
  "FarmSaved2_1": "He’s not much of a talker, but I can tell he’s relieved.",
  "FarmSaved2_3": "Indeed. Alright, let’s be on our way!",
  "GreatOakVillage_1": "Scout’s visited before, but I presume this is your first time in Great Oak Village, {SHERIFF_NAME}?",
  "GreatOakVillage_3": "Most of us are Druids in training, hence all the gardens.",
  "GreatOakVillage_4": "Make yourselves at home, and take a rest if you need it. The path ahead is substantial.",
  "GreatOakVillage_6": "Precisely. When you’re ready, meet me by the south fence.",
  "TalkToDevinah_1": "Feeling rested?",
  "TalkToDevinah_3": "Ah, that would be the Swamp. Most Druids haven't been in there since-",
  "TalkToDevinah_6": "That’ll be the Ringleader Bloons.",
  "TalkToDevinah_7": "Quick! We need to protect the town!",
  "CoveredGardenNext_1": "I can feel the wind coming from the gardens!",
  "StillMoreToGo_1": "The gardens…",
  "StillMoreToGo_3": "I will be. I know we can cultivate them again soon, but I wilt when I see our precious gardens attacked like this.",
  "StillMoreToGo_5": "Very true, but the thrilling chaos of that movement, focus and fresh air is worth it.",
  "StillMoreToGo_7": "As I was saying, focus is key. We need to get them clear of the village!",
  "CornfieldNext_1": "The damage to those hedges sorely needs tending, but no time now. We need to make sure our food supply is safe!",
  "RingleaderThreatCleared_1": "Thank you for your help. I hope one day we aren’t troubled by these Bloons, and the plants won’t need to struggle.",
  "RingleaderThreatCleared_3": "I do love a good leaf!",
  "RingleaderThreatCleared_4": "Now, the trail to the Ancient Forest leads west of here, but we’ll need to keep a sharp eye out for more Bloons along the way.",
  "RingleaderThreatCleared_5": "Meet me by the river crossing down the trail when you’re ready. If your Posse needs a rest, remember you can swap in fresh Ranch Hands at the Campfire.",
  "StartJourneyToAncientForest_1": "Shall we continue?",
  "MonkeyMeadowNext_1": "I feel more wind…",
  "MonkeyMeadowNext_3": "I wasn’t going to mention that. I meant actual wind, coming from the Meadow.",
  "DownstreamNext_2": "Shhhh! Listen.",
  "DownstreamNext_3": "I think they’re trying to make their way back to town, either reserves or reinforcements.",
  "DownstreamNext_4": "Hurry back and we can catch them!",
  "SpringSpringNext_2": "I think we’re safe to head onward now.",
  "SpringSpringNext_4": "The other Druids!",
  "SpringSpringNext_6": "Let’s continue on, and keep your wits about you. This is just the beginning.",
  "MonkeyMeadowsCleared_2": "It’s Devinah, and I agree. We’re nearly at the Ancient Forest, where the Druids draw much of their power.",
  "MonkeyMeadowsCleared_4": "Oh, many Druids express that talent. Wait until you see us conjure a lightning tornado!",
  "MonkeyMeadowsCleared_6": "You’ll be fine. So long as you don’t cross a Druid! Anyway, it’s just through here, follow me.",
  "NewBloons_1": "Here we are, this is the Ancient Forest!",
  "NewBloons_2": "They say fairies live here, and while I’ve never seen one myself, I do feel their presence.",
  "NewBloons_4": "The Grand Druid says this place is older than time itself.",
  "NewBloons_6": "More Bloons! We have to hurry!",
  "BalanceNext_1": "The Bloons have never been so close to the heart of the forest.",
  "BalanceNext_4": "The circle. They’ll be headed for the circle!",
  "EnchantedGladeNext_1": "We have to hurry! They’ll damage the tree!",
  "EnchantedGladeNext_3": "The Ancient Tree. This forest is perfectly balanced, and all of its energy is centered at the Ancient Tree at the top of the valley.",
  "EnchantedGladeNext_4": "We can’t let them harm it!",
  "HeartOfTheForest_1": "Thank you for helping protect the Ancient Tree.",
  "HeartOfTheForest_3": "I was thinking the same thing. Hrmm... in that case there’s likely only one other place they could have come from.",
  "HeartOfTheForest_5": "The Swamp.",
  "HeartOfTheForest_6": "But the thing is, a while ago some Monkeys started saying they saw ghosts in the Swamp.",
  "HeartOfTheForest_8": "There were always a few Bloons there, but after the rumors started Monkeys stopped going and it became overrun. There are beautiful trees there, but our village is too far away to effectively protect them.",
  "HeartOfTheForest_9": "But now I wonder if it's got something to do with that tunnel you two found that’s brought all the new Bloons.",
  "HeartOfTheForest_11": "Please take care, and consider bringing others to aid you. I’m not sure how many Bloons might be in there.",
  "HeartOfTheForest_13": "I’m sorry, the village will need me to help restore the forest.",
  "HeartOfTheForest_15": "You’ll find the trail to the Swamp past the barricades you saw on the eastern side of Great Oak Village.",
  "HeartOfTheForest_16": "Good luck, and may the spirits of the forest guide you.",
  "DevinahAtYourSide_2": "Scout, {SHERIFF_NAME}, what’s wrong?",
  "DevinahAtYourSide_4": "A what!?",
  "DevinahAtYourSide_6": "Wait one moment. I’ll let the villagers know, but then I want to come with you to help.",
  "DevinahAtYourSide3_1": "Okay, they’re all preparing. Where to now?",
  "DevinahAtYourSide3_3": "Normally I’d say stay away, but this monster is the real threat. We can meet at the campfire in the Swamp.",
  "HelpFromGrave_4": "Then let’s send it on its way!",
  "BackUnderground_1": "It’s looking worn for wear at least.",
  "BackUnderground_6": "I will.",
  "FinalStand5_1": "You will feel the wrath of the forest!",
  "WeDidIt6_1": "I see, so Mermonkeys care about the ocean in the same way we Druids feel about the forest.",
  "WeDidIt6_3": "Well, you’re always welcome in our grove. Now that the Diamondback’s gone, we’ll be able to nurture our gardens and forests to their former glory.",

  "DidntNeedHelp_3": "Hmph!",
  "DidntNeedHelp_6": "A tunnel? You mean you’re not…? I’m sorry, I thought you two were looking for something else.",
  "DidntNeedHelp_7": "You describe what I’ve been patrolling. A long stretched out tunnel right? As if something was digging?",
  "DidntNeedHelp_9": "Yes, it appeared not long ago, and there've been ground tremors too. I didn’t see the Bloons coming from there but they have increased in number.",
  "DidntNeedHelp_10": "If that’s all you need to know, I need to get this information to, uh, back as soon as possible.",
  "DidntNeedHelp_12": "I’m not sure if that’s possible. You say this extends up into the desert?",
  "DidntNeedHelp_14": "This threatens us all then. If I do this for you, both of you must promise me something.",
  "DidntNeedHelp_16": "Absolute secrecy. The location of my home must remain a secret!",
  "DidntNeedHelp_18": "Unfortunately, and it’s rattling our home to its foundations. I owe you one after you, I admit, assisted me earlier.",
  "DidntNeedHelp_21": "Alright, I’ll swim in front and lead the way, but you’d better keep up!",
  "WhatMermonkeys_1": "The tunnel isn’t far from here. Follow me up the cliff this way.",
  "WhatMermonkeys_3": "For as long as I want to, yes.",
  "Peninsula_1": "By the sea spirits!",
  "Peninsula_2": "There’s so many of them! I need to go check on the other Mermonkeys. Can you handle the Bloons up here in the meantime?",
  "Peninsula_4": "I’ll come back and find you as soon as I can!",

  "ProtectMermonkeyHome_10": "This way!",
  "LuminousCoveNext_1": "They come no further! You Bloons will taste the true power of the sea!",
  "MermonkeyHomeSaved_1": "Thank you for helping us protect our home.",
  "MermonkeyHomeSaved_2": "Now I can show you the tunnel, this way.",
  "HeresTheTunnel_1": "Here we are.",
  "HeresTheTunnel_3": "We have Mermonkeys stationed here often and have always prevailed. But the size of these attacks are nearly overpowering.",
  "HeresTheTunnel2_2": "I trust you won’t make me regret that. Few Monkeys have seen this place, and even fewer welcomed as guests.",
  "HeresTheTunnel2_4": "Where are you headed next?",
  "HeresTheTunnel2_6": "Nonsense, I’ll open up a secret passage for you to use.",
  "HeresTheTunnel2_8": "We have them everywhere. How do you think we started the stories that we can be in multiple places at once?",
  "ClearingTheWay_1": "Stand back.",

  "ClearingTheWay2_5": "I’m sure we will. Good luck!",
  "CrevasseReturn_2": "I heard through the seavine you Monkeys might need help with this monster on the loose.",

  "CrevasseReturn_11": "Are you sure they do?",
  "OnItsTail_3": "Don’t worry Scout, us Mermonkeys won’t let it harm the Cove. You go on ahead, see if you can cut it off further up!",
